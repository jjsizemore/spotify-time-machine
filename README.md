### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using pnpm (recommended):

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Development Features

In development mode, you'll have access to advanced debugging tools:

- **Real-time Token Status**: Monitor authentication state in the bottom-right corner
- **API Queue Monitoring**: Track request processing and rate limiting
- **Manual Token Refresh**: Test authentication endpoints directly
- **Enhanced Console Logging**: Emoji-coded status updates for easy debugging

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: Next.js app router components, pages, layouts, and API routes
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components (including new `TokenStatus.tsx`)
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for data fetching and caching (enhanced with error handling)
- `src/lib`: Utility functions, API client setup, and token management utilities
- `src/styles`: CSS and styling files
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions

### Key Files

- `src/lib/spotify.ts`: **Enhanced** Spotify API client with enterprise-grade features
- `src/hooks/useSpotify.ts`: **Enhanced** authentication hook with error recovery
- `src/lib/tokenUtils.ts`: **NEW** Token management and monitoring utilities
- `src/components/TokenStatus.tsx`: **NEW** Real-time development debugging widget

## Enhanced Architecture

### Authentication & API Layer
The application now features a sophisticated authentication system:

```typescript
// Advanced Token Management
- Proactive refresh with 5-minute buffer time
- Direct fetch() calls with no-cache headers
- Automatic refresh token rotation
- Comprehensive error handling with session management

// Enterprise Spotify API Client
- Request queuing with priority system
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Rate limiting protection and request deduplication
- Development debugging with queue status monitoring
```

### Error Handling Patterns
Consistent error handling across the application:

```typescript
import { SpotifyApiError } from '@/lib/spotify';

const { spotifyApi, isReady, error, retry } = useSpotify();

if (!isReady) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (error) return <ErrorDisplay message={error} onRetry={retry} />;
```

## Code Quality & Development Tools

The project uses modern tooling for enhanced development experience:

# Test token refresh endpoint (development only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/refresh-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refreshToken":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"}'
```

## Security Enhancements
