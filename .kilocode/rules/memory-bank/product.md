## Purpose

The Spotify Time Machine exists to help Spotify users gain deep insights into their listening history and create meaningful playlists from past music discoveries. It solves the problem of Spotify's limited native analytics by providing comprehensive visualization and playlist generation tools.

## Problems Solved

- Lack of detailed listening history analytics in Spotify
- Difficulty recreating past music discoveries as playlists
- No way to visualize music taste evolution over time
- Limited tools for exploring liked tracks chronologically

## How It Works

Users authenticate with Spotify OAuth, then can:

1. View dashboard with top artists, tracks, genres, and recent plays
2. Browse monthly timeline of liked tracks with full details
3. Generate playlists from specific time periods
4. Visualize listening trends and genre evolution
5. Provide feedback and report issues through the feedback system
6. Monitor application storage and performance (development mode)
