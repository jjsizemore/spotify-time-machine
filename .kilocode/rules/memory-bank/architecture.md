# Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

The Spotify Time Machine is a Next.js Progressive Web App that integrates with Spotify's Web API to provide music analytics and playlist generation. It follows a modern full-stack architecture with client-side rendering, server-side API routes, and sophisticated state management.

## Source Code Organization

- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and API routes
  - `api/auth/[...nextauth]/`: NextAuth.js authentication routes
  - `dashboard/`: Main dashboard page with stats and visualizations
  - `history/`: Monthly listening history timeline
  - `playlist-generator/`: Custom playlist creation interface
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components organized by feature
  - `features/`: Feature-specific components (stats, playlist, visualization)
  - `layout/`: Layout and navigation components
  - `ui/`: Base UI components (buttons, forms, modals)
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks for data fetching and business logic
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and API clients
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Next.js App Router**: Modern routing with server components and API routes
- **TanStack Query**: Advanced data fetching with caching, background updates, and error handling
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication with Spotify OAuth provider
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom Spotify-themed design system
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the application
- **PWA Features**: Service worker, manifest, and offline capabilities

## Design Patterns

- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate data fetching and business logic (useSpotify, useLikedTracks)
- **Compound Components**: Related components grouped together (StatsTabs, VisualizationContainer)
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Provider Pattern**: Context providers for global state (NextAuth, QueryClient, Analytics)
- **Analytics Integration**: Platform-native monitoring with Sentry, Vercel Analytics, and Next.js built-in insights

## Component Relationships

- **Data Flow**: Hooks → Components → UI, with TanStack Query managing server state
- **Authentication**: NextAuth session → useSpotify hook → API client → Spotify API
- **State Management**: Local component state for UI, TanStack Query for server state
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error display with retry options across components

## Critical Implementation Paths

- **Authentication Flow**: `/auth/signin` → NextAuth → Spotify OAuth → Dashboard
- **Data Fetching**: useSpotify hook → spotify.ts client → API routes → Spotify API
- **Playlist Creation**: User selection → API route → Spotify API → Success feedback
- **Visualization**: Raw data → Processing hooks → Chart components → Interactive UI
- **Analytics Integration**: Platform-native monitoring with Sentry error tracking, Vercel Analytics, and Vercel Speed Insights
