# These values are used ONLY for testing and should NEVER be real credentials.
# Tests must be isolated from production environment to ensure:
# - Reproducible test behavior across different machines
# - No accidental use of production credentials in test output
# - Tests can run without requiring actual API credentials
# - CI/CD pipelines can run without secrets
#
# IMPORTANT: This file contains TEST mock values ONLY
# DO NOT put real credentials here
# DO NOT commit real credentials to version control
